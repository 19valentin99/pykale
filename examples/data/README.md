# Data

**Separate data and code**

To download by code or other ways to local directory rather than upload to GitHub.

In general, we do not upload data to keep the repository size small. All data in examples (so far) are from the public domain so they are downloaded into local directories rather than uploaded to GitHub. This is done by setting `.gitignore` (see line 7). If we do want to share data, the data should be external to the PyKale repository (Google drive is popular nowadays).
